                                        <h3>History</h3>
                                        <p>The Cowboys began play in 1960, and played their home games a few miles east of Downtown Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. For their first three seasons, they shared this stadium with the Dallas Texans (now the Kansas City Chiefs franchise), who began play in the American Football League that same year.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Winning Championships</h3>
                                        
                                        <p>The Cowboys have played for 10 NFL Championships and have won 5, all five being Super Bowls. The Cowboys won Super Bowls VI, XII, XXVII, XXVIII and XXX. They also played in and lost Super Bowls V, X, and XIII. The franchise has experienced two major periods of continued success in their history.</p>
                                
                                        <h3>Cowboys Net Worth</h3>
                                        <p>The Dallas Cowboys is the most valuable sports team in the world according to Forbes, worth a staggering $5 billion.
                                            It's the fourth consecutive year that the NFL outfit has topped the rankings, this year fending off competition from teams from the worlds of baseball, basketball and European soccer.
                                            Owned by businessman Jerry Jones, the defending NFC East champions generate twice as much sponsorship and seating revenue at its AT&T Stadium than any other team.
                                            Major League Baseball (MLB) outfit New York Yankees jumped up from fifth last year to second, with its value coming in at $4.6 billion -- an annual increase of 15%.</p>
